	<h2>Area 51 Cabin</h2>
	 <p>Have you ever wanted to explore Area 51 but the U.S. Air Force says it is a &quot;restricted area&quot;? Well, now you get the chance to stay in your own Area 51 cabin (government secrets not included). This unrestricted cabin is located a quarter mile into the forest where you can have more privacy during your stay, while also being more immersed in nature.

	 <ul class="listb">
	   <li>Canoes</li>
	   <li>Life Jackets</li>
	   <li>Firewood</li>
	   <li>Fishing Rods</li>
	 </ul>

	<h2 class="last">Second Floor</h2>
      <p>As you go up the stairs, you board your own flying saucer; three viewports showcasing the marvelous cosmos. With alien writing scrawled on the walls and photos of seemingly foreign planets displayed, you sleep peacefully on a large king-size bed. The soft, ambient glow of bioluminescent lights casts a soothing hue throughout the room, illuminating the intricate designs etched into the metallic surfaces.</p>

	  <p class="spacing">Above the bed, a holographic projector displays mesmerizing constellations, helping you drift off to sleep while you dream of your next cosmic adventure. Just outside your viewport, a shimmering nebula swirls, inviting you to explore the mysteries of the universe beyond.</p><br class="clear2">
