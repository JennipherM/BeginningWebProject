	  <h2>The Europa Cabin</h2>
		<p>Scientists believe that Jupiter's 4th largest moon is one of the most promising places to find life outside of our own planet. Rent our Europa cabin and become the life that science has been looking for! With our water ice theme, you will be launched to Europa's surface where you can relax a half mile into the forest. Just like our Area 51 cabin, this cabin contains two floors, with our top floor being a flying saucer, as well as a storage shed containing:</p>
		<ul class="lista">
		  <li>Canoes</li>
		  <li>Life Jackets</li>
		  <li>Firewood</li>
		  <li>Fishing Rods</li>
		</ul>

  <h2 class="clear2">First Floor</h2>
	<p class="spacing">As you enter this new abode, you are met with a cool-toned living room containing a comfortable L&ndash;shaped couch next to a toasty tabletop fire on a coffee table, all under a bright glacial ceiling. Soft, ambient lighting casts a warm glow across the room, accentuating the rich textures of the decor. With multiple chairs, this space is perfect for a gathering of friends or family, inviting laughter and conversation.</p>

	<p>Windows frame a view of the surrounding landscape, allowing natural light to flood the room during the day. This floor also includes a private bathroom, featuring a soothing whirlpool bathtub, candles and plush towels available for a spa-like experience, making it a tranquil retreat after a long day.</p><br>

	<h2 class="last">Second Floor</h2>
	  <p class="spacing">Going up to the second floor, you are met with an icy bedroom, truly emanating Europa's ice&ndash;covered oceans. Below a sparkling crystal chandelier, a king&ndash;size bed awaits the tired explorer. The icy walls seemingly melt in areas, exposing the frigid ocean waters below.<br><br> The blue and white in the decor mirror the beautiful hues of Europa's surface, transporting you to the depths of Jupiter's mysterious moon. Plush, frost-themed throw pillows adorn the bed, inviting you to sink into comfort after a long journey.</p><br class="clear2">
